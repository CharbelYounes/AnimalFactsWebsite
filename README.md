# Animal Fun Facts Project by Charbel Younes ULFG-II

## 1. API Used
This project uses the [API Ninjas Animals API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/animals) to fetch fun facts and information about animals. API requests are made to:
```
https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/animals?name={animal_name}
```
with an API key for authentication.

## 2. Project Description
Animal Fun Facts is a modern, responsive web application that allows users to discover interesting facts about animals from around the world. The site features:
- A home page with a welcoming hero section
- An interactive gallery with animal images and fun facts
- An about page describing the project and its features
- An animal facts section where users can search for fun facts about any animal using a public API
- Light and dark mode support for a better user experience

## 3. My custom requirement: "Include a sticky top navigation bar with at least 4 internal links" Explanation

This project features a sticky top navigation bar on every page, implemented using Bootstrap 5's `navbar` component with the `sticky-top` class. The navigation bar remains visible at the top of the viewport as users scroll, providing easy access to all main sections of the site. It includes at least four internal links:

- **Home**: Links to the main landing page (`index.html`).
- **Animal Facts**: Links to the animal facts search and API integration page (`facts.html`).
- **Gallery**: Links to the interactive animal gallery (`gallery.html`).
- **About**: Links to the about page with project and contact information (`about.html`).

This ensures smooth navigation and a user-friendly experience, allowing users to quickly switch between different sections of the site from anywhere. The navigation bar is also responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, with a collapsible menu for mobile devices.
